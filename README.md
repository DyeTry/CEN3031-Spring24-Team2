# Campus Parking Manager

## Project Overview:
The Campus Parking Manager is a system that will provide the rules, directions, enforcement, and administration to the desired users for properly managed parking on the UWF campus. This will allow for tracking and viewing of parking zones, allowed vehicles, users, license plates, and tickets, as well as administrative tools provided to the parking faculty of the University.

## Project Requirements:
Develop a Campus Parking Manager that includes:
- A visual GUI for users to interact with
- The ability for users to buy and renew parking passes
- The ability for users to view parking zones and allowed vehicles
- The ability for users to view tickets
- Administrative tools for superusers to manage the parking manager
- The ability to manage tickets given by Law Enforcement
- The ability to allow employees to deliver parking passes to customers
- Database(s) to store user and employee information
- Write documentation for proper use of all features

## Project Outcomes:
 - A fully developed Campus Parking Manager will allow end users to intuitively navigate through the Campus Parking Manager and easily support the end users goal.
 - Documentation written for a User Guide and Administration Guide.
